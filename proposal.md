# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Asteroid Escape

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where the player controls a spaceship that tries to escape an asteroid field to different areas with different challenges.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan on making a game reminiscent of Asteroids. The player will control a spaceship sprite on the screen with a number of asteroids flying around it. If an asteroid hits the spaceship the ship is destroyed and the game is over. The player will be able to shoot from the front of the ship to destroy asteroids. When all asteroids are destroyed the player will be able to take on another challenge.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Implement simple destructable asteroids that move around the screen and can destroy the player sprite.
Have one additional area with another challenge ie launching and guiding a probe to a particlar spot on a large asteroid or planet.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Implement asteroids with different properties such as exploding asteroids or indestructable asteroids that must be avoided for a certain amount of time.
Have two areas, one the same as above and one where the player must fly through a tunnel dodging stalactites and stalagmites.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The same as above but have the asteriods drop powerups such as a field that destroys asteroids that come too close or a shield that can be hit three times without destroying the player's ship.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to become more familiar with Lua. I will need to learn how to create and define objects and define their properties. I will need to learn how to create and manage a screen with multiple moving objects going every which way. Also I have never made a video of a project before so I will have to learn how to do that as well.
